4981,,093095,Instrument Development,murphyd,05-30-2008,osbornej,1,89,Adapter needed for Nikon Ti scope and Thorlabs LED Ring light,We would like to obtain a coupling piece between our Nikon Ti microscope and a Thor Labs LED ring light illuminator.  If you will recall  we did a quick fix a couple of weeks ago using a binding from Reed Georges 52mm photographers filter plus an O-ring.  We are hoping we can get a Thor Labs adapter that will work as a more permanent fix.  We returned the filter binding back to Jason.     The microscope is a Nikon Ti inverted light microscope.  The packing slip listing the Thor Labs lamp parts is enclosed  and the Thor part numbers are listed best on page 2 of the PDF.     I remember Xavier Darzacq saying that the Nikon adapter that is available fitted to the older model Nikon Te 2000  but no longer fits to the Nikon Ti.  If this is the case  Thor Labs Nikon adapter would not work  in which case we would need to make something  and perhaps even buy a camera filter and use the filter binding and O-ring trick.

Guinea pig anti-Parvalbumin and rabbit somatostatin were combined in this process with the concentration of 1:500 diluted in 1% triton X-100  1% goat serum PBS buffer  and then anti-rabbit AF488 and anti-gp AF594 were applied as secondary antibody with the concentration of 1: 500. After staining  all sections were mounted at slides with Vestashield DAPI medium.    Biocytin staining was performed on 3 sections followed IHC staining  and sections were stained with ABC solution overnight at cold room  and developed with DAB sloution 1:30 hrs at RT. After staining sections were mounted with Aqua Polymount.    This project was requested on June 12  and started both IHC and biocytin stains on June 17. Brenda did Biocytin staining on other sections after examination of results  and it worked well.     Notes:  1. IHC stains have high backgroud. It might caused by thick (at least 300um) and old sections.   2. Biocytin stainings did not show up well  and Brenda did biocytin staining only later and it worked well. IHC staining might affect Biocytin stains somehow  or might be caused by other reasons.  3. Need to figure out IHC staining with thick and old sections.,Histology/anatomy Facility,,51605

The system is coming in by the end of August and it would be helpful to have these enclosures within two weeks after.,Instrument Development,This ticket has been open to long.

These had both a diameter of 6mm (diameter of the ball).    We would like to try some larger balls.

[http://workorder.int.janelia.org/helpdesk/WebObjects/Helpdesk.woa/wa/ticket?ticketId=5343]  ,Instrument Development,We have finished creating two IDF interface boxes.  With some initial PCB error we had to manufacture again.  We did finish final box and tested them in behavioral rig setup.  We found out the Lever press signal could not be monitored from the Island Motion Software.  After extensive testing it turned out to be followings:     1.  Breakout box signal for Lever press signal is different from tradional TTL or CMOS compatiable signal (for details see attachment Email_10_24_08.pdf)    2.  We have provided a solution which includes modification of ID&F box and Retractable Lever sense lines.      Finally I have delivered scientist two final boxes and six retractable levers (modified) for final testing.  If scientist is happy  we will go ahead and manufacture 20 boxes and modify related Lever boxes.  To remove confusion  IDF have implemented serial numbering scheme.

We?d like to put an additional 2X mag just before the camera so that she?ll have a bit more mag for patching under oblique illumination/epi. But there?s a height and adaptor constraint on her rig that prevents the standard Olympus mag changer from being usable so we?d like to use what Sam suggests below to do the trick (they can give us a 2X lens but don?t have a standard coupler available). Question for you is if you?d have the time to quickly design and send a coupler off for fab for us.

Here was the old problem report:  The axial PSF of the TableDOM rig was measured to be 2.8-3.2 um.  The same objective  while on a new DOM rig from Sutter  produced a <2.5 um axial point spread function.  It should be possible to improve the TableDOM psf  probably by using a different scan lens or tube lens  or possibly through changing some other optic earlier in the beam path.  D. Flickinger will continue to work on this  when possible.,Instrument Development,Closing this ticket.

Each piece is designed to raise the laser so that the beam height is 4.5".  In the notes I write that the 'top and bottom' should be flat and smooth to .001".  The top and bottom surfaces are shown in the 405 drawing. You had asked if we wanted them anodized - I don't think we do.       We would like to get 2 of each the 405  488  and 642 platforms  while only 1 of the 532 for a total of 7 pieces.  Please do not hesitate to call/email me with any questions.

The slides were coverslipped and sealed with polish.  This project was requested on 8/15/08 and completed on 9/15/08.  Also  a previously perfused and sectioned mouse brain (#7831) was stained with blue Nissl  and slides were coverslipped and sealed with polish.  This project was requested on 8/13/08 and completed on 8/29/08.  On three occasions in September 2008  rat hippocampal dissociated cultures were prepared  followed by electroporation of cells with provided DNA constructs  then maintained.  Additional material fees are included in the final cost.  Each request was completed within two days.,Histology/anatomy Facility,,51605

This version will be 16 channels (1 intan chip). The intan chip plus a small omnetics connector will be attached to a dragonfly (I will build this part). omnetics connector output will be attached  via thin wires  to a small control box containing the intan control circuitry found in the current Leonardo Lab intan retina MUX.  Output of this box will be a labview cable connector to stream directly to a nidaq board.    I would like to meet to discuss technical specific of the project and get an estimated time-to-completion. This is for the Olberg visiting scientist project  and we would like to have it completed by Nov 10.,Instrument Development,Research small transistor based amplifiers  met and discussed w/ anthony.  Placed an order for various components.  $60,51607

I've put them in a bag labeled with your name in our deli fridge.    And yes  there was enough in samples B1-B4 to aliquot for sequencing  so I did pass that on to Torrey.  After you and I spoke about it  I did the additional 100 ul elution through the same strip of B1-B8 columns as you requested.    So  what I'm trying to say...in the bag that you pick up  even though it is labeled "16 minis " you will find a total of 24.  They are B1 -B8  D1-D8 and then B1' - B8' (2nd elution through same column).  I hope this is not confusing!  If so  just see me next time you come to visit.  Have a great weekend.  DeNiece,51602

Three attempts were made with #68 and two tries with #67.  In both cases  two different manufacturers (Fermentas and NEB) were used.      I have also digested each vector with BglII only and HindIII only just check the sites - they are okay.    I did a transformation last night and the vector background is still very high.

The fragment sizes were not matching up to the map.  However  according to Suxia and Caiying  if the sequence/backbone between and including the ITRs were flipped  then what was observed in the photos would match the virtual clone.  Tianyi asked me to repeat the digests perfomed by Suxia on my CAG-Flex stock.  I included Torrey's stock as well in my digests.    It apprears that the fragments observed for the panel digest of Torrey and my CAG-Flex vector agree with expected fragments sizes if sequence between and including ITRs in the backbone region is reverse complemented.    cost includes 1 hour time  $12 for enzymes  $5 agarose gel,51602

9689,,093206,Histology/anatomy Facility,sternsons,02-27-2009,hua,1,907.5,Perfusion and vibratome sectioning of 3 mice plus IHC,On 02/09  three mice (two orexin CrexR26R #8701  #13420  and one Pomc1-creACTB#8694) were perfused via pump method using pre-warmed PBS and 4% PF fixatiive  followed vibratome sectioning at the thickness of 50 through hypothalamus. Sections were directly collected on slides.    IHC (Rb anti-GFP) was performed on all of slides. Rb-GFP was used as primary antibody  which dilution is 1:2500; and anti-Rb AF 488 was used as secondary antibody with dilution of 1:500. IHC was performed at different days. After IHC  slides were coverslipped with Vestashield DAPI (hard set).    Note: The isssue of this  IHC is blood vessel showed up signal  possible reasons:  1. Used pre-warmed PBS and fixative  2. Rb-GFP antibody has problem  3. Anti-Rb AF488 has problem.    Solution: Try to apply the same primary (Rb-anti-GFP) to both Scott' and Deniz's sections  then use different concentrations of secondary antibody (anti-Rb AF488) to different sections.    Hours included time spending preparation of fixative for perfusion.    This project was requested on 02/06 and completed on 02/13.              ,Histology/anatomy Facility,,51605

After checked under microscope  # 15030 and #15032 had strong green fluorence signals.    On 03/03  another three mice (#14752  #15028  #15029) were perfused with pump method by using pre-warmed fixative (4% PF in 0.1 PB)  followed vibratome sectioning at the thickness of 50 um through hypothalamus. Sections were directly collected on slides. All of these mice slices have strong signal.     On 03/05  five mice (#14760  #15033  #15034  #15035  #15036)   were perfused with pump method by using pre-warmed fixative (4% PF in 0.1 PB)  followed vibratome sectioning at the thickness of 50 um through hypothalamus. Sections were directly collected on slides.    Some slides were coversliped with vestashield DAPi which slides were seleced by investigator  and some slides were used for IHC.    This project was requested to proceed on 03/02  and completed on 03/09.    Hours included time spending fixative preparation.      Issues:   --Vibratome sectioning of #14752 was not going smoothly  vibratome cut half of brain every other section. In order to solve problem  blade was changed  also tried to re-glue block to stage  but problem still existed. To avoid this kind of problem occur again  need to discuss with machine services.            This project was requested to proceed on 03/02 and will be done on 03/06,Histology/anatomy Facility,,51605

10045,,093216,Instrument Development,gustafssonm,04-14-2009,duttaa,1,456,Fabrication of a demux circuit for the shutter controller,According to the camera hardware guide  the FIRE TTL output of the camera  which we would use as the input for your circuit  is some AC family logic circuit in series with 50 ohm. In principle that should be able to source 24 mA  judging from random AC family data sheets I found  which would satisfy the >5 mA that the TLP797J apparently requires. But the manual also says to load with >1 kOhm  which would not quite satisfy the TLP797J requirement. I?m unsure whether it would be a bad idea to load the camera output with the TLP797J (in series with 1 kOhm or so). We may be able to skip the optoisolation; the NM shutter drivers all have optoisolated inputs anyway  which should hopefully keep their considerable transients out of your part of the circuit. The only remaining purpose of optoisolation would be to prevent a ground loop involving the camera and computer  a problem that we could either ignore  or deal with simply by not connecting the ground wire of the FIRE input (and using isolated BNC connectors that don?t short the shield to the box).    I assume the hex gate you linked to was for the input OR-gate purpose? Unless I?m confused  it can?t source enough current to serve the output driver purpose. The MUX is active low  and the NM shutter drivers take active high input  so the MUX needs inverting drivers on the output. These have to be able to source at least 1.5 mA into {2 kOhm + 1V drop}  preferably with margin. How about a 74AC540 or equivalent?    I am leaning towards an arrangement where this MUX circuit and four of the NM shutter driver boards (the CX1100B ? yes the CX1100 data sheet you linked to is the correct one) share a single enclosure. Each CX1100 board contains its own AC power supply  which may be a bit silly that but could actually be helpful in preventing the large current spikes that each driver outputs from propagating to anywhere unwanted. These four drivers would use four of the possible outputs of the MUX. Assuming that we do have a spare DIO bit available on the NI card  we would route the remaining four MUX output channels to BNCs (via the inverting drivers)  for hypothetical future external shutter drivers. It would be slightly useful (but not crucial) to include the polarity toggles we talked about for these channels. For the NM channels polarity toggle are of course not needed  because we know the required polarity already. If there are no toggles  the polarity for the BNC outputs should be active high  like the NM channels. If there is no spare DIO bit available  we?d just eliminate the BNC channels and go with the 4 NM channels.    The CX1100 drivers would drive LST200 shutters. These have cables with a strange 3-pin connector on the end. NM says the mating bulkhead connector is SwitchCraft Mini-C2 TY3F  and they have already sent off four of these directly to you via UPS 3-day (for the outputs of the NM drivers).    As you saw in the data sheet  the CX1100 has several utility connections  some of which we should make use of:    LED S     Drives an LED to indicate shutter active. We should implement this LED  for each channel.     TBLOCK   Interlock. We should route these to a terminal block on the front panel  to allow interlocking if necessary.    LED Power    Indicates power on.  We could implement this LED on one channel to indicate power on for the whole box? But you wanted to power your section separately  so it may need its own power-on LED?    LED Armed   Indicates armed condition.  We should implement this LED  for each channel.    +5 V DC      Do not use    SWITCH      Opens shutter regardless of input. Should be wired to a front panel toggle switch for each channel.    PUSH          Resets the driver to armed condition after power out etc. Should be routed to a momentary-contact push button (per channel?).    Four drivers take a lot of room. Can they be stacked in pairs?    AC to the drivers should come via a standard AC cord connector (on back)  a fuse (?)  and an on/off toggle switch (preferably on the front). Since AC is supplied  the 5V for your logic should probably come from a supply inside the box. The driver boards do supply 5V  but I don?t want to use it for upstream logic  because doing so would defeat their internal optoisolation.,Instrument Development,Added April labor to the cost field  8 @ 57 = $456,51607

I started growing cultures of all 48 samples (A1-H1  A2-H2  A3-H3  A4-H4  A5-H5  A6-H6) today and please do a miniprep on Monday and then sequencing again with Lin 0.5f.  The plate is growing in our small incubator next to the cold room.  (I just changed temp from 37 to 30).  Kevin  could you also send my minis to ?Genewiz? as well just in case the sequencing fail again. Thanks.     Lin        ------ Forwarded Message  From: "McGowan  Kevin M." <mcgowank@janelia.hhmi.org>  Date: Sun  15 Mar 2009 12:43:27 -0400  To: Janelia Farm <tianl@janelia.hhmi.org>  Subject: your sequences from the weekend    Lin     I took a look at your sequencing reactions from the weekend and they are mostly bad. I tried to get you some extra basecalls on them by reextracting the data using a less stringent analysis protocol. You will see in your folder a new folder called ?reanalysis of 3-14-09? or something like that. The reanalysis is done with very low quality score threshold so please be careful in interpreting the results. Please also note that I did not rename the samples when I reanalyzed them  I just put them into a different folder.    The failed sequences appear to have high background ( a lot of noise)  which can come from poor priming or template contamination. The ones that do look OK  a few of them stop prematurely like maybe the sequence is GC rich. My recommendation would be to send these reactions to our contract company  Genewiz  and see if they can do a better job of it. We can arrange the samples for shipping  if you like. We have a protocol for GC-rich samples that may help with the ones that have worked; if you would like us to run this subset using this protocol let me know.     Kevin   ,51602

Sections were floating in PBS at 24-well plates.    Immunostaining (goat anti-c Fos) was performed on three sections of each brain. Goat c-fos was used as primary antibody  which dilution is 1:100; and donkey anti-goat AF 488 was used as secondary antibody with dilution of 1:250. IHC was performed at different days.     After IHC slides were coverslipped with Vestashield DAPI (hard set).    Note:   1. Sections were mounted on slides 30 mins earlier before IHC.  2. Background is little bit high  the possible reason is the concentration of secondary antibody is too high.    Hours included time spending preparation of fixative for perfusion.

Today was a very successful day and a 100 by 100 step routine was created to capture the entire surface of a rivet which closely simulates a specimen eye which eventually we hope to measure.    5 or 6 thousand points were captured of the surface  but this proved to be a time intensive process taking 4 or 5 hours due to each point requiring more than 1 second to capture.  Finding ways to speed up this process without jeopardizing quality of measurements needs to be found.  Larger step sizes would increase speed at the cost of resolution.  ,Instrument Development,2 hours May 22  2 hours May 25,51607

It will be built in-house if ID&F can produce a device which is significantly cheaper than any commercial solution.  This is likely.    The device should have similar capabilities to the SHG device from APE.  Pointing stability is important  auto-wavelength tuning is moderately important  conversion efficiency is not as important.

11647,,093213,Instrument Development,leonardoa,06-03-2009,duttaa,1,0,Discuss the issues with Intan,I've messed around with the intan board for a few days. We are still having some drift problems  and ID&F assistance would be very valuable in solving them. My lab can be used for testing  if this is helpful. To begin I'd like to summarize the symptoms:    (1) 60-ch ITO electrode array  electrodes coated with TiN to ~1.0-1.5MOhm impedances (10um electrodes). in this config we have electrodes sitting in saline.  	(a) in RSE mode (Vdiff->Agnd)  electrode voltages drift to  	 ~1.3V DC offset out of intan chips; 30uV bg noise. note that amps run to +-2.5V  so this is not saturated.  	(b) in diff mode  electrodes close to 0V DC  ~10uV RMS (note I am giving DC offset in amp output levels  and RMS noise in gain-adjusted electrode levels).    In RSE mode  signal generator input S+ applied directly to one electrode pin (w/ S- to gnd) looks to be the expected voltage. so signals are getting through.    (2) MUX gnd has 20 Ohm impedance to rack adjacent to rig. swapping "analog gnd" (to table  cage  array) between rack and MUX does not have much effect. the difference in gnd potential between the rack and the intan board is slightly troubling  because (for example) if i bring in another input to the nidaq which is at rack gnd (eg a photodiode) there is now a potential for mixing of gnds signals. there concern along these lines is that perhaps this is already happening somehwere in the system.   But again  this may not be pertinant to the drift problem.    So it is essentially RSE mode where we have problems (both drift and RMS noise level)  which is puzzling.  It could be that V+ and Vdiff are drifting together  but it is not clear why this would be the case. If I swap out the electrode array and put in a test circuit that grounds  V+ to V- via a 200KOhm resistor  all problems seem to vanish (no DC offsets in diff or RSE; rms noise of 5uV and 7uV  respectively).    There are known drift problems (seen by various collaborators) with these intan amplifiers with certain electrode types; these are hypothesized to be due to electrochemical effects at the electrode interface. Example -- silicon probes work poorly  tungsten electrodes work well. Impedance does not appear to be the issue.  This is all anecdotal. There are also options w/ altering the composition of our electrodes if electrochemistry is the problem.    Long story short -- the problem here may very well be due to the ultra low cutoff of the intan chips  perhaps in combo with our array electrodes. Reid has suggested sticking a high pass filter on at the electrode pin (pre-intan)  and it may be that this + some digitial hpf will solve the problem. We need to pin the problems to either the intans or the board. It would be great if we could scrutinize the design of the MUX board very closely  both to see if there are any obvious errors but also to determine if we can add in any aux circuity to ameliorate the problem if they are at the intan level.    I suggest we brainstorm a bit today on options  and then maybe get together in the lab tomorrow morning to try some things.    I appreciate the help!    anthony      ps.    A few minor comments from Reid on the board layout (again  prob not relevant but I pass them along as an FYI):     >>  (1) You might reduce the crosstalk you're seeing if you buffered the analog output signals before the cable and NI board.  As I mentioned earlier  I think that's probably a bit too much capacitance for the chips to drive so quickly  so you always see a bit of the previous channel.    (2) For a board this size  I would have made the power traces much wider.  I would have made as much of the bottom of the board a solid ground plane as possible  and used wide traces for +5V.   >>    misc notes from me:    (1) i've measured the capacitance through the ni cable to the pc -- 160pF. this is within spec  but a bit high re: Reid point #1 on crosstalk above.  (2) i measured fast settle low time out of the MCU -- about 0.5s. Reid thinks this is fine.  ,Instrument Development,Submitted May Billing  Labor = $114  No Materials Cost  Total $114,51607

The lab has constructed a device that has a vibrating motor assembly suspended using long elastic bands. The lab selected vibrator motors from consumer product electric toothbrushes and wired two together. The fiber is looped in a figure 8 pattern with the crossing co-located with the vibrator motor. the external loops of the figure 8 are suspended and allowed all degrees of freedom. The apparatus worked well except that the lifetime of the motors are short. The motors need to be driven with a 1-5Vdc or 1-10Vdc input to allow a variable speed.

The remaining stage of this project will be to incorporate the control system into a final version of the board to include other devices (DAC  ADC  a few other convenient components for putting in an enclosure). Finally this system should  be stuffed by a 3rd party and tested at Janelia by Jin Liu and Michael Reiser. Final design files should be appropriate for sharing with the existing community of users of the display system.    Additionally a simple modification to the PCBs for our existing visual displays will complete this project.,Instrument Development,,51607

Images were taken for the whole brain   followed vibratome sectioning of brains between red signals at the thickness of 60um. After dried a couple of days  brain slices were rehydrated with PBS  then coverslipped with fluromount medium.    Issue--Brain slices looked transparent and it is hard to take image with dark field.  Trouble shooting--  1. Using extra brain slice tried two mount media: Aquamount and Fluromount  2. Tried different brain mounting process   1) Coverslipped brain slices right away after mounting on slides                                            2) Let brain slices dry then rehydrated with PBS  followed coverslipped with two media  Results:  1. Fluromount gave better contrast compared Aquamount media  2. Dry-rehydration process weakened contrast compared direct mounting    This project was requested to proceed on 06/30  and completed on 07/06/09.,Histology/anatomy Facility,,51605

This would allow several people to  interface between omnetics connectors that are standard on electrodes with  adaptors that are often found on other devices (preamps  headstages  etc.).
