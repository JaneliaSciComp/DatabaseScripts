November 27, 2005 - 1.6:
Fixed the first line of the file - it was missing a character. 
Made Gem runnable - i.e., now you can do "pqa -file [..etc, etc]" after doing a "gem install pqa"
Various minor speed improvements.
Wrote more unit tests.

January 31, 2005 - 1.5:
Fixed a bug that would sometimes associate a duration measurement with the incorrect query.
Fixed a bug which would cause the HTML report to error out with a nil-dereference exception.
Fixed a bug which cause PQA to choke on SQL statements that were issued as part of a stored procedure.
Restored the ability to run under Ruby 1.6.8.

July 27, 2004 - 1.4:
The syslog parser now checks for either LOG or DEBUG entries.
Fixed a bug in the syslog parser that would choke on entries like "postgres starting".

June 18, 2004 - 1.3:
Improved MySQL query log support.
Parse errors (if they occur) are now included in the report.
The default log format is now "pglog".  Syslog still works, but you'll need to specify "-logtype syslog".

June 8, 2004 - 1.2:
Added MySQL query log file support.
Fixed bug - duration report links no longer appear in header if duration information is not available.

June 7, 2004 - 1.1:
Syslog parser now handles durations.
Added text versions of duration reports.
Removed some spurious entries from the reports (i.e., BEGIN;ROLLBACK).

May 17, 2004 - 1.0:
Now numbers are normalized - i.e.; "select bar where foo=222" normalizes to the same query as "select bar where foo=123312321".  This means more accurate information on what queries are occurring most frequently, taking the most time, and all that.
Fixed bug - OverallStatsReport no longer displays "longest ran in 0.0 seconds" if the log does not include duration information
Fixed bug - OverallStatsReport now displays the correct number of unique queries.  v0.9 listed the same number for both total and unique queries.
Fixed various bugs in syslog parsing - now it should work better with both PG 7.3 and PG 7.4.  It's still a better idea to use the Postgres log, but if you must use syslog for some reason, it's better now.

May 11, 2004 - 0.9:
Added ability to handle Postgres logs where log_pid/log_timestamp/log_connection has been enabled
Modified to support both "query:" and "statement:" as log entry preambles - i.e., works with PG 7.4 logs now.
The SQL colorizing works a bit better.
Updated documentation to include better postgresql.conf configuration details.

May 7, 2004 - 0.8:
Added UPDATE queries to the "Queries by type" report
Added support for parsing query duration data from the Postgres log
Added a "Queries that took up the most time" report
Added a "Slowest queries" report
Added a table of contents to the HTML report

April 28, 2004 - 0.7:
Added support for using Postgres log file.  syslog is still supported, of course.
Fixed bug which resulted in errors if the number of valid queries in a log was less than -top.  Thanks to Tom De Bruyne for reporting this bug.
The SQL colorizing works a bit better now.
Various tweaks to HTML reports.

April 23, 2004 - 0.6:
Added a 'rank' column to the 'MostFrequentQueries' report.
Colorized the SQL keywords in the HTML report.

April 7, 2004 - 0.5:
Added HTML reports.

April 6, 2004 - 0.4:
Fixed a bug which prevented single digit date logs from being parsed.

March 17, 2004 - v0.3:
Fixed an off-by-one bug in the number of reports returned.
More optimizations, should again be about 10% faster.
Added a "query frequency by type" report.

March 9, 2004 - v0.2:
Fixed a connection id bug.
Various optimizations, should be about 10% faster.
Improved packaging.

March 5, 2004 - v0.1:
Can display queries by frequency.
Performs query normalization.
